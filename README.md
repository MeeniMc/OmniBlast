OmniBlast: Blast Furnace and Smoker recipe list completed
=========================================================

OmniBlast is a quality of life Datapack for Minecraft that completes the
recipe lists of the Blast Furnace and Smoker to enable faster cooking for
blocks and items that have only a standard Furnace recipe (e.g., Glass,
Glazed Terracota, Cactus, etc.)

As usual, cooking time is divided by two w.r.t. the Furnace, XP gains are unchanged.

Blasting
--------

* Glass (from Sand and Red Sand)
* All color Glazed Terracotta
* Terracotta (from Clay block)
* Bricks (from Clay, Netherack)
* Cracked Bricks and Tiles (Deepslate, Nether, Blackstone, Stone, etc.)
* Cobbles to Stone (including Deepslate)

Smoking
-------

* Lime Dye (from Sea Pickle)
* Green Dye (from Cactus)
* Popped Chorus Fruit (from Chorus Fruit)
* Sponge (from Wet Sponge)

Notes
-----

1. Glass recipe inputs from tag `#smelts_to_glass` and thus should be compatible with mods
